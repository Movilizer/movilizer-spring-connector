/**
 * The consolidation of the moveletsets has to mirror the behavior expected in the MDS.
 *
 * The consolidation logic is based on the fact that the MDS processes the MoveletSets in order. If this ever changes
 * this part should be adjusted accordingly.
 *
 * Since on production cases the use of movelet delete is heavily discouraged, the movelet deletes are ignored. This
 * might arise some doubts on the movelet lifecycle for some use cases but here we propose solutions for several use
 * cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Movelets has to be deleted after some action is completed -> use single movelet</li>
 *     <li>Movelet has to disappear from device -> remove movelet assignment from participant (remember to have a reasonable
 *     "valid till date" so the movelet is removed at some point from the MDS)</li>
 *     <li>Movelet needs to be updated -> increase the version</li>
 * </ul>
