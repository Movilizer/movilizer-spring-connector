# movilizer-spring-connector

The Spring connector uses Java to integrate with the Movilizer Cloud. It offers solutions for standard challanges while integrating with the Movilizer Cloud and creating a mobile process based on the data coming from a backend.

The connector offers:
* Annotation based mappers for DataContainers and MasterData
* an outbound and inbound queues for Movilizer messages.
* Spring based lightweight configuration
* out of the box configuration for asynchronous service calls.

For examples on working with the connector please check the test cases of this project or the [movilizer-spring-connector-example-project](https://github.com/Movilizer/movilizer-spring-connector-example-project).
